# Medical Bot with Advanced RAG Pipeline üè• ü§ñ
## Overview

The **Medical Bot** is an intelligent and powerful healthcare solution designed to assist both medical professionals and patients by providing accurate, evidence-based medical information. It leverages **Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline with the use of **multi agents system**, which enhances traditional AI models by combining the power of document retrieval and generative language models. This hybrid approach allows the bot to access and retrieve relevant medical documents from vast datasets, analyze them, and generate responses tailored to user queries.

With this system, users can interact with the bot to receive answers grounded in the latest medical research, guidelines, and patient-specific data. It can process medical records Lab reports, medical research articles,etc, making it highly versatile and capable of supporting a wide variety of medical use cases.

## üåü Features

- **Advanced RAG Pipeline**
  - Context-aware information retrieval and chuncking
  - Hybrid Semantic search capabilities
  - Dynamic document ranking (BM25+semantic retriever)
  - Query routing
  - Multi agent System

- **Medical Document Analysis**
  - Insight generation 
  - Diagnosis and recommendations
  - Metadata extraction and organization

**Retriever-Augmented Generation** (RAG) is a technique that enhances the quality and relevance of generated text by incorporating a retriever. The retriever selects the most pertinent context from external documents, which then informs the generation process. This approach is valuable for producing accurate and contextually relevant responses, as it provides the model with focused context from external sources.

## Building a RAG-Powered Chatbot

In this section, we demonstrate how to build a chatbot using RAG to answer questions based on a given context. We‚Äôll use **Ollama models** and **embeddings** to create a simple Streamlit app capable of answering questions based on context ingested in a vector store database.

## Docker Image Documentation

## Overview

This Docker image provides a containerized version of the `medbot` application, ready to run in any environment that supports Docker.

The Docker image includes everything needed to run the app, including the necessary libraries and dependencies. This image is designed to work for anyone needing to deploy the app in a consistent and isolated environment.

## Prerequisites

Before using the image, make sure you have the following:

- Docker installed on your system.
- Access to Docker Hub or the ability to pull from a private registry.

## How to Pull the Image

To download or "pull" the image from Docker Hub, use the following command:

```bash
docker pull ion780/medbot:latest
```
Once the image is pulled, you can start a container from it. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name myapp-container ion780/medbot:latest
```
## Ollama

Ollama is a library built on top of the Hugging Face Transformers library, offering an easy way to implement Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) in projects. With a simple API, Ollama enables seamless integration of any retriever and generator model from the Hugging Face model hub. 

You can download Ollama from its [official website](https://ollama.com/).

## Multi Agent System (crewai)

Multi-Agent Systems involve multiple autonomous agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks. Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of the task, and they communicate and coordinate with each other to improve efficiency and decision-making. This collaborative approach allows for scalable and flexible solutions.in our case we used **Crew.ai** which is a powerful platform that facilitates the creation and management of multi-agent systems. It enables the orchestration of decentralized agents, allowing them to work together seamlessly across various domains like automation, AI, and healthcare. With its modular architecture, Crews.ai simplifies the development and deployment of complex, collaborative solutions.

## Getting started:
In order to run this app we need to install first our requirements dependencies using pip, to do that make sure to use the code below:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/el-Badr07/medical-bot

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd MED-BOT

# Run the application
streamlit run LLM.py.py
```
